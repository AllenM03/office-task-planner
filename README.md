# Work Day Scheduler

Work Day Scheduler is a webpage that lists every hour of the day (12am-11:59pm) as a new row. Inside of each row, you can write down some task that you wish to accomplish within that given hour. Here's an example:

In the way that this application is coded, the events saved for a certain date and timeblock (e.g. today at 9AM) would not be shown when the page is loaded on another date as the keys that were used for saving the events include both the timeblock and date when the event was saved.
